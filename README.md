It sounds like you have a plan for networking and driving sales for your own freelance web design/development/seo marketing business going forward, and that's great. Specifically, you've chosen small business owners that have zero web presence as your target demographic - which is quite specific. This information needs to shape all of your content and UI design ideas going forward. 

You've stated in your Persona that you'll have to "convince" your clients that a website is necessary for business. So I'm a bit confused by the following line: "..._are self employed and are accustomed to diffrent technology platform as example apple or android and are looking for help growing there business through a business website._" If they are looking for help to grow their business with a website why would you still need to "convince" them, and I don't know what you mean by "different technology platform as example apple or android"?

The reason I'm picking this apart in such detail is because everything that's outlined here will determine what features, functionality, and content you will need to build into your site going forward. This skill is especially important for freelancers to know how to do well. Outlining project purpose, audience, goals and personas is not only important in regards to the design of a project, but also in determining project scope. You must be able to do these things well if you want to freelance successfully. 

Another question: Do you have a background in SEO? We do not cover SEO in class.

Your project and files are all set up OK - but unfortunately since the Persona is not done according to the directions I can't pass this Milestone as is. As of now this work stands at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Please redo the Persona according the instructions and let me know ASAP when changes are complete. Please see Edits &amp; Suggestions below.
